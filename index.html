            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="bio"> I’m a Web Developer with a knack for problem-solving. I recently graduated from Bloc’s 8-month Web Development Track. My proudest achievements are ones that require strategy, attention to detail, and persistence. I have a passion for collaboration and am known to go above and beyond for those I’m working with. I make it a priority to learn and advance my skills frequently. </div>
            <div class="bio"> Programming languages aside, I am passionate about studying spoken languages that will lead me on new adventures. I graduated from Concordia College with a major in Political Science and minors in Spanish and Psychology (Go Cobbers!). When I’m offline, I enjoy reading, hanging out on my family’s hobby farm, and speaking at local Toastmasters meetings. My favorite time of year is fall because of warm blankets, IPAs, and scary movies. </div>

            <div class="description">This goal of this project was to build and deploy a well-architected, dynamic, accessible client-side app. I wrote JavaScript code to evaluate answers and lead users through each page of the app and created additional CSS to style the application.</div>
